# Railway-Management-System

Railway is a very important part of Indiaâ€™s transportation system. Proper 
management of it is equally important. There are so many trains and so many 
passengers as well, along with different ticket fares based on compartments.
Different trains have different timings and different routes as well. If they are 
not managed properly, there would be absolute chaos. The main objective of 
this project is to provide solution to this problem by providing a system which 
would reduce the manual work and help in the management. This project is 
totally built at administrative level and thus only the administrator is guaranteed 
the access. This project is focused on a single railway station.
